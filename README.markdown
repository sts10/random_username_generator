## Usage

1. Clone down the repo

The executable is `rug`, so if you run `cargo install --path .` you'd be able to use `rug` to run the program.

## On the words used

As is, the word list the program uses is adapted from [an AgileBits word list](https://github.com/agilebits/crackme/blob/master/doc/AgileWords.txt). The [EFF long word list](https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt) is included in the repo as well for your convenience.
